# Distill-Factory

Distill-Factory is a framework for synthetic data generation. Currently, we have integrated two tools: **Distill-r1** and **Distill-sft**, which are used for generating long reasoning data and SFT (Supervised Fine-tuning) data, respectively.

## Features

- **Integration of multiple synthetic data generation methods**
- **Convenient generation pipeline**
- **Support for both open-source models and proprietary model**
